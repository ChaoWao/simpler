# `qwen3_14b_decode/` — Qwen3-14B 40-layer decode (CANN fused attention)

Self-contained SceneTestCase port of pypto-lib
`models/qwen3/14b/decode_fwd.py` entry `decode_fwd_layers` with
`_CHUNK_NLAYERS == 40`: **the whole Qwen3-14B decode stack as one fused
dispatch** (hidden → hidden, no LM head), with the FP32 inter-layer residual
carry. A simpler developer builds and runs it directly — no descent through
pypto-lib / the JIT, no auto-built intermediate artifacts.

The layer loop is a real loop in the generated orchestration
(`for (int64_t i = 0; i < 40; i += 1)`), not an unrolled one, so a 40-layer
chunk costs one extra literal over a 2-layer chunk rather than 20× the kernels.

## Parameter regime — matches `stress_profile.py`

The fixture mirrors the vLLM serving stress run (`stress_profile.py`):

| Param | Value | Source |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| `BATCH` | 16 | `CONCURRENCY` (aligned with decode kernel BATCH=16) |
| `MAX_SEQ` | 5500 | `max_model_len` (KV-pool / RoPE sizing) |
| decode `seq_len` | 3500 | the ~3500-token prompt |
| layers | 40 | full model (`decode_fwd_layers` N=40) |

Per the lib's const-layer-0 stacked-fwd reference, every layer reuses layer-0
weights (weights + paged KV pool are stacked ×40 along dim 0, one slice per
layer); each layer still reads and writes its own KV pool.

Footprint at this regime, bf16:

| component | size |
| --------- | ---: |
| weights (×40) | 24.61 GiB |
| paged KV pool (×40) | 13.44 GiB |
| **total fixture** | **38.05 GiB** |

Die HBM is 64 GiB, so it fits with ~26 GiB of headroom for ring heap and
workspace. The run needs no `runtime_env` tuning — the default ring heap, task
window and dep pool carry the 40-layer graph, because each layer's
intermediates live inside that iteration's scope and are freed at its end, so
the live set does not grow with layer count.

## Dataflow per layer (`_decode_layer`)

input RMSNorm → split-K SPMD Q/K/V (seed + atomic-add) → **`paged_attention_rope_cce`**
→ split-K out_proj + residual → post-RMSNorm → SwiGLU FFN → `dcr_xgamma`.

`copy_hidden` embeds the bf16 input; the FP32 residual is carried between
layers; `copy_out` does the single FP32→bf16 round at the chunk tail.

The attention stage is one **CANN `FusedInferAttentionScore` extern** that
subsumes what used to be seven generated kernels — it folds per-head Q/K
RMS-norm, RoPE, the paged KV write, the flash-attention inner loop and the
online softmax into a single mixed (AIC + 2×AIV) task, gated by an
`AscendC::SyncAll<false>()` FFTS barrier. `paged_attention_tiling_cce` builds
its runtime tiling metadata first.

Paged KV uses vLLM's **BSND** layout: a page holds `[BLOCK_SIZE, KV_HIDDEN]`
ordered `[page, token, kv_head, dim]`, so `slot_mapping[b]` is directly the
row index. (The previous harvest used NSND; the golden was updated to match.)

## Provenance — how the C++ was produced

| component | source |
| --------- | ------ |
| pypto-lib | `45be52c` |
| pypto | `d64380cb` |
| ptoas | `v0.48` |
| pto-isa | `83d01313d9bfc247c4b7c8bcf969d1019f0d106f` (`pto_isa.pin`) |

`kernels/orchestration/` + `kernels/aic/` (18) + `kernels/aiv/` (16) are
harvested pypto codegen for `decode_fwd_layers` (`_CHUNK_NLAYERS=40`,
`PTO2_MANUAL_MAX_SEQ=5500`) — license header prepended, otherwise verbatim.
The `CALLABLE` is transcribed from that run's `kernel_config.py`, and
`simpler_setup/goldens/qwen3_14b_decode.py` ports the per-layer
`golden_decode_layer` math (RoPE θ=1e4, controlled scales, FP32 residual, bf16
cast points) composed over 40 layers with FP32 carry + per-layer KV pools.

**There are no hand-edits.** The previous harvest patched `fa_fused_aiv` to work
around a `[[block_local]] static`; that kernel no longer exists (attention is
the extern now), and the current codegen emits no such construct.

### `kernels/vendor/paged_attention_cce/` — the attention extern

Copied verbatim from pypto-lib
`models/qwen3/14b/kernels/paged_attention_cce/`. The tree must stay intact:
`kernel/fai_body.hpp` reaches its dependencies through relative includes, so
splitting it would mean patching the source and re-patching on every refresh.

- `attention_rope/`, `tiling/`, `kernel/`, `generated/` — PyPTO-authored glue.
- `vendor/fused_infer_attention_score/` — **CANN `FusedInferAttentionScore`,
  Copyright (c) 2025 Huawei Technologies, CANN Open Software License 2.0**
  (~16 k LOC), upstream's own vendored copy, left where upstream put it.
- `attention/` is the non-RoPE variant of the extern. `decode_fwd_layers` does
  not use it; it is kept so a refresh is a plain directory copy.

**Why it sits under `kernels/vendor/`.** Nothing below a `vendor/` directory is
ours to reformat: the repo's header, formatting and language lint all skip that
path (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `tests/lint/check_headers.py`). Without that,
`clang-format` rewrites the glue files and `end-of-file-fixer` touches the CANN
headers, and the next refresh diffs against *our* reformatting instead of
against upstream — which is how the drift this example is meant to expose starts.
The carve-out keys on the directory, not on this operator's name, so harvesting
another extern is a matter of dropping it in `kernels/vendor/` with no lint
change at all.

Building these needs **CANN devkit headers** (`$ASCEND_HOME_PATH/aarch64-linux/asc/…`,
`tikcpp/…`), declared per-incore via `extra_include_dirs` in the `CALLABLE`.
`$ASCEND_HOME_PATH` keeps them machine-independent; paths a given CANN layout
does not ship are dropped rather than failing the build.

They also depend on simpler linking incore objects before extracting `.text`
([#1497](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/pull/1497)): AscendC declares
`g_vecTPipePtr` / `g_kfcClient` as block-local globals, whose relocations no
amount of inlining removes.

### To regenerate

From a simpler worktree with pypto + pypto-lib cloned under `build/` (see the
[`multi-repo-setup`](../../../../.claude/skills/multi-repo-setup/SKILL.md)
skill) and `eval "$(pypto-setup --export)"`:

```python
# PTO2_MANUAL_MAX_SEQ must be set before importing decode_fwd (read at import).
os.environ["PTO2_MANUAL_MAX_SEQ"] = "5500"
D = <import build/pypto-lib/models/qwen3/14b/decode_fwd.py by path>
D._CHUNK_NLAYERS = 40          # read at trace time; rebind before the first call
D.decode_fwd_layers(*inputs, out, config=RunConfig(
    platform="a2a3", codegen_only=True, save_kernels=True, save_kernels_dir=OUT))
```

`codegen_only` needs no device. Then copy `OUT/orchestration/`, `OUT/kernels/`
and `models/qwen3/14b/kernels/paged_attention_cce/` into `kernels/vendor/` here, and
re-transcribe `CALLABLE` from `OUT/kernel_config.py` (which already records
`func_id`, `core_type`, per-kernel `signature`, and `extra_include_dirs`).

One deliberate deviation from `kernel_config.py`: `decode_fwd_layers` declares
`k_cache` / `v_cache` as plain inputs, but the extern writes the current token's
KV into them. The `CALLABLE` marks them `INOUT` so simpler copies the pools back
and the golden can verify all 40 layers' KV writes, not just the hidden output.

## Running

```bash
# pytest (hardware; wrap in task-submit on shared boxes)
pytest examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/qwen3_14b_decode \
    --platform a2a3 --device ${DEVICE}

# standalone
python examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/qwen3_14b_decode/test_qwen3_14b_decode.py -p a2a3 -d ${DEVICE}
```

DFX is opt-in via the existing flags — no kernel changes needed:

```bash
pytest .../qwen3_14b_decode --platform a2a3 --device ${DEVICE} \
    --enable-l2-swimlane 1 --enable-dep-gen
```

Note that `--enable-dep-gen` / `--enable-l2-swimlane` on the full 40-layer graph
can overflow the per-run SHM record buffer ("records dropped"); pypto-lib warns
about the same thing for `decode_fwd.py --fwd-layers`. Capture on a smaller
harvest if you need a clean trace.

## Status — PASSING

Passes on device: output **and all 40 layers' KV caches** match the torch
reference at `RTOL=5e-2 / ATOL=1e-1`.

In CI it runs as its own `st-onboard-a2a3` step on a dedicated device, not in
the general scene-test sweep: at ~5 min it would eat over half that sweep's 600 s
session budget, and keeping the budget short there is what makes it a hang
detector. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Measured on an idle a2a3 die, one device: **~5 min wall** for the whole case,
of which ~11 s is fixture generation and ~49 s the torch golden (both host-side,
single-threaded torch over 40 layers × 16 batch × 8 KV heads); the rest is
kernel compilation, the 38 GiB host→device upload, and the device run itself.
