"""Shared CLI log-level helper.

The CLI accepts a string from {debug, info, timing, warn, error, null} or a
raw integer; we map it to a Python `logging` level and call
`logging.getLogger("simpler").setLevel(...)`. The C++ side picks up the same
level through the native state seeded at `Worker.init()` time (one-shot
snapshot) — there is no env var; the Python "simpler" logger is the single
source of truth.

pytest is intentionally not touched — it has its own `--log-cli-level` and
pyproject `log_cli_level` knobs.
